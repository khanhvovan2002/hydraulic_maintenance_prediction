## Overview

Maintenance prediction using machine learning models is a challenging task that requires collaborative efforts to ensure model stability in real-time deployment. This project focuses on developing a model to detect abnormal working conditions of critical components in the hydraulic system.

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to create an accurate and reliable predictive maintenance model that can identify potential failures or anomalies in the hydraulic system. By detecting these issues in advance, proactive maintenance can be performed, leading to increased system reliability and reduced downtime.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of sensor data collected from a test rig for hydraulics. It includes various parameters related to the hydraulic system's performance and operation. The dataset is preprocessed and prepared for analysis and model training.

## Tasks

This project involves the following tasks:

1. **Task 1: Time Domain Analysis using SVM and XGBoost**
   - Apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost models to perform time domain analysis.
   - Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and feature extraction.
   - Evaluate and compare the performance of the models.

2. **Task 2: 1D CNN Network for Multihead-Channel Analysis**
   - Design a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture specifically tailored for hydraulic maintenance prediction.
   - Utilize upsampling and downsampling techniques to handle input data.
   - Train and evaluate the CNN model for accurate prediction.

## Results

The results obtained from this project demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed models in predicting abnormal working conditions in the hydraulic system. The evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, provide insights into the model's performance and can be used to assess its reliability.

## Future Enhancements

The project can be further improved and extended in the following ways:

- Explore additional machine learning algorithms and architectures to compare and improve the predictive performance.
- Investigate the use of advanced signal processing techniques for feature extraction and representation.
- Incorporate real-time data streaming and continuous monitoring for proactive maintenance.
- Consider scalability and deployment aspects for integration with an industrial hydraulic system.
