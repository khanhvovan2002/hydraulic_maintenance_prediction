# hydraulic_maintenance_prediction
Maintenance prediction using machine learning model is an daunting work, it involves many people to collobrate for keep the model stable in the pipeline, especially when deployed in realtime.<br>
This research work focus on building model that detects the abnormal working conditions of important components in the hydraulic system. The datasets particularly the sensors data used was collected a test rig hydraulics<br>

<br>This work has two tasks:
* Using SVM and XGBoost model, with PCA for dimension reduction and feature extraction in time domain analysis
* Design 1D CNN network multihead-channel, with upsampling and downsampling for input data
